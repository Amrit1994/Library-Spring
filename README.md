## Library Portal (in Spring)

Spring MVC web application for borrowing and managing library books inventory.

### Description

This is my first Spring MVC project, which is an implementation of the library website. The application allow to borrow books (as a standard user),
manage books inventory (add new ones, check availablity, etc.) and user account.

In my Library Portal I plan to have three types of users: 
 * Readers - they can register themselves and borrow limted number of books,
 * Librarian - limted number of users that have some insight on library inventory and add new books,
 * Admin - person, who can add, edit and deactivate users, also have some insight on the library inventory.

### Blog Posts
